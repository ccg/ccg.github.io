(Full disclosure: Amazon affiliate link.) It&amp;rsquo;s one of the best keyboards I&amp;rsquo;ve owned. I&amp;rsquo;m a fan of mechanical keyboards, but I don&amp;rsquo;t always like the long keystrokes required on those keyboards, and they&amp;rsquo;re often way too loud. This keyboard solves both those problems using the Kailh blue low-profile switches. The keystrokes are not quite as shallow as they are on an Apple keyboard, but I find it easier to type on than something like an IBM Model M keyboard with the old-fashioned buckling-spring keys.</description></item><item><title>SGI IRIX Archaeology</title><link>https://ccg.github.io/2018/02/08/sgi-irix-archaeology/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccg.github.io/2018/02/08/sgi-irix-archaeology/</guid><description>I found some old stuff from 2008 while I was cleaning up my home directory. Since SGI and IRIX are now footnotes in the history of computing, I thought these things might have a tiny amount of value to future historians.
UI for SGI 1600SW Flat-Panel Display in IRIX 6.5 UI for SGI Presenter display in IRIX The SGI Presenter panels are even rarer than the 1600sw, so here&amp;rsquo;s a screenshot of the IRIX UI for a Presenter:</description></item><item><title>Chargify vs. Spreedly vs. Cheddargetter: Subscription-Billing Service Prices</title><link>https://ccg.github.io/2009/12/03/chargify-vs-spreedly-vs-cheddargetter-subscription-billing-service-prices/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Dec 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccg.github.io/2009/12/03/chargify-vs-spreedly-vs-cheddargetter-subscription-billing-service-prices/</guid><description>We&amp;rsquo;re looking at chargify.com, spreedly.com, and cheddargetter.com to manage subscriptions for a SaaS web app we&amp;rsquo;re developing at pybrew.com. I made some graphs to see how their prices scale with the number of customers they&amp;rsquo;re managing for your business.
Spreedly charges per transaction, whereas chargify and cheddargetter charge per customer. For these graphs, I&amp;rsquo;m assuming that it&amp;rsquo;s simply one transaction per customer per month, but spreedly&amp;rsquo;s curve will go up or down if you charge more or less frequently than monthly.</description></item><item><title>Changing Metacity's window-placement behavior</title><link>https://ccg.github.io/2009/06/02/changing-metacity-s-window-placement-behavior/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jun 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccg.github.io/2009/06/02/changing-metacity-s-window-placement-behavior/</guid><description>For a GNOME user, there are several ways to modify window-placement behavior. These are the ones I&amp;rsquo;m currently aware of:
Patch Metacity to behave differently. Replace Metacity with XFCE&amp;rsquo;s xfwm. Replace Metacity with Compiz (i.e., activate 3D desktop effects). Replace Metacity with KDE&amp;rsquo;s kwin. Replace Metacity with Openbox.</description></item><item><title>Miscellaneous Technical Tips and Tricks</title><link>https://ccg.github.io/2008/12/26/miscellaneous-technical-tips-and-tricks/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccg.github.io/2008/12/26/miscellaneous-technical-tips-and-tricks/</guid><description>IRIX Networking When moving an SGI IRIX box to a different subnet, edit /etc/config/static-route.options so that the gateway IP address is correct:

This page has good information on custom video modes for the SGI O2: http://dart.ncsa.uiuc.edu/slevy/o2-stereo/
The author of that page has a zip file with useful files and information: o2-stereo.tar.gz
I wrote a couple video modes of my own:
1400x1050 @ 60 Hz 1400x1050_60.info 1400x1050_60.vfo 1400x1050_60.vfs 1600x1024 @ 60 Hz 1600x1024_60.info 1600x1024_60.vfo 1600x1024_60.</description></item><item><title>Replace Metacity with Compiz and Fix Window Placement</title><link>https://ccg.github.io/2008/04/17/replace-metacity-with-compiz-and-fix-window-placement/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Apr 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccg.github.io/2008/04/17/replace-metacity-with-compiz-and-fix-window-placement/</guid><description>Replace Metacity with Compiz and Fix Window Placement Compiz has a plugin called &amp;ldquo;place&amp;rdquo; that has window-placement options.

http://doc.gwos.org/index.php/Xfwm4 http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=88393 Note that the Ubuntu instructions don&amp;rsquo;t quite work for Debian because of Debian&amp;rsquo;s customized /usr/bin/gnome-wm. On Fedora Core 6, GNOME doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to acknowledge the $WINDOW_MANAGER env var, so it&amp;rsquo;s necessary to use gconf:
gconftool-2 --type string --set /apps/gnome-session/rh/window_manager /usr/bin/xfwm4 Why xfwm4 rules:
Window placement can be configured to be non-annoying.</description></item><item><title>Metacity window-placement patch</title><link>https://ccg.github.io/2005/03/11/metacity-window-placement-patch/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Mar 2005 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccg.github.io/2005/03/11/metacity-window-placement-patch/</guid><description>Metacity window-placement patch A patch to modify Metacity&amp;rsquo;s window-placement algorithm so that all new windows are centered in the viewport.
2018-02-08 Update I moved the files from my personal web server to a repo on GitHub:
https://github.com/ccg/metacity-window-placement-patches
The links below have been updated accordingly. Also, I put &amp;lsquo;2005-03-11&amp;rsquo; as the date for this post. I lost the original revision history for this page, and that date is my best guess based on the dates in the patch files.</description></item></channel></rss>
