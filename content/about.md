My name is Chad Glendenin, and I am currently working for [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/).
I have worked for large companies like Silicon Graphics and small startups like
Choose Energy. In Chicago, I worked for a high-frequency trading firm before
founding a small consultancy.
I was also part of the leadership of two Chicago-based startups.

In the mid-2000's, I had a stint in academia. At the University of Chicago,
I completed a masters degree while also working as a teaching and research
assistent. I worked for the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, and I
had a position at the Argonne National Laboratory's Mathematics and Computer
Science Division.
