For a GNOME user, there are several ways to modify window-placement behavior. These are the ones I'm currently aware of:

1. [Patch Metacity to behave differently.](/2005/03/11/metacity-window-placement-patch/)
2. [Replace Metacity with XFCE's xfwm.](/2007/06/05/replacing-metacity-with-xfce-xfwm4/)
3. Replace Metacity with Compiz (i.e., activate 3D desktop effects).
4. Replace Metacity with KDE's kwin.
5. Replace Metacity with Openbox.
